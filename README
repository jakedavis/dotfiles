Dotfiles

I just use .gitignore * to manage them.

WM:           Xmonad (with Xmobar)
Shell:        Zsh (with Oh-my-zsh)
Terminal:     Rxvt-unicode
Editor:       Emacs
Extras:       Tmux

I also use Vim for quick editing. Some of the themes and packages I also use include:

Desert theme for vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=105
Haskell-mode: https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode
Emacs-starter-kit: https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit
Oh-my-zsh: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
